**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**:
unzip the main file you downloaded into xplane>custom scenery folder OR just drag the "MDPC - Punta Cana" out of the zip file directly into your xplane>custom scenery folder

IF YOU ARE HAVING ERRORS:
1. check that you have all of the libraries installed. You need the following libraries installed
	RA Library v1.1+
	MisterX Library v1.5+
	PP Library v1.2+
1a. Verify you installed both the base and the update for RA Library. You can check that you have done this by looking in the files for RA_Library>Vegetation>GreenLandscape>Lawn01.for as that file is only present when you have 1.1 installed
2. Make sure you unzipped the folders properly. You should have inside your xplane>custom scenery folder a folder called MDPC - Punta Cana and inside that should be 3 other folders along with this readme
3. Make sure your scenery load priorities are set properly. Check the scenery_packs.cfg file and make sure this scenery is listed. If it is there and it still doesnt work then delete your scenery_packs.cfg and releaunch the sim, that file will regenerate and it should fix it. 
4. If you check all of this and it still doesnt work then send me a message on reddit or on the org

If you find any issues with the scenery or think something should be changed just send me a message and I'd be glad to update it. 

I always have more things that I wanted to include but didn't have time to add. I listed below a few things on my list that I would like to include in future updates however if you want to do any of them and send me a message I will be glad to update the official download and include you in the credits. I included the wed file so it should be easy to mess around if you want to change anything. 

## THIS IS A BETA, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK IF YOU DOWNLOAD IT!
#### Instructions for using the beta release

1. Download the latest build from this github repo. This is where the project will be most up to date
2. Install the scenery using the instructions listed above
3. Use the scenery, poke around, try to find issues, and most importantly, make sure to write them down when you find them!
4. Check your list against the list of known issues below. You don't need to repeat anything on that list in your report. Those are all things I am aware of and are in the process of being fixed or just have not been implemented yet. 
5. Post your findings on the forum post or send me a message via any of the methods I listed above

#### Known issues with the current beta release

-08/26 edge lights should be in the grass

-no ortho overlay (this is tentative, there isn't any good source so this might not happen)

-VIP terminal and FBO terminal buildings are not accurate to the real thing

-VIP terminal and terminal A are missing the airport signs

-terminal B expanded apron is missing. This will not be included in v1.0.0 as I don't have enough source imagery to do it up to the accuracy of the rest of the airport

-missing vehicle ground routes

-mysterious floating lights over some buildings
